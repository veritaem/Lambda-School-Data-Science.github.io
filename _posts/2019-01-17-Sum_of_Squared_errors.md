title:  Sum of Squared Errors
category: S
description: The Sum of Squared errors is what happens when you take the distance of each point in your dataset and measure its distance from a line, usually the line of best fit.  From there you square them so they all have the same sign, and add them up.  this will give you the total error of your line, which is useful for having a baseline to improve your predictions and test your models.
