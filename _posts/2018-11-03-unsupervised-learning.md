Unsupervised learning is a machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets without labels. 

'Labels', in this context, refers to some outcome or target variable. When a target variable is not present in the data, there is no prediction for which to optimize.

In this case, unsupervised learning provides us with a number of exploratory data analysis algorithms to find hidden patterns or grouping in the data. Common applications of unsupervised learning include:

1. Clustering - Identifying groupings of related observations
2. Dimensionality Reduction - Reduces the number of variables taken into consideration via methods of feature selection and feature extraction
3. Association Rule Learning - Discovering relationships between observations in a dataset
